# Shake it! A cocktails web app

## Description:
This application serves as the culmination of my efforts in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, where I demonstrate my expertise in web development while showcasing my passion for mixology. This is a dedicated website that revolves around cocktails and drinks. Here, you can explore a wide variety of drink recipes and the necessary ingredients to make them. Alongside an extensive collection of cocktail recipes, I provide food pairing ideas to enhance the drinking experience.

The development of this website involved the utilization of React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. To populate the content, I incorporated two different APIs: The Cocktail DB and The Meal DB, which offer free access at their basic level.

## Getting started:
Set up your local development environment by following these steps:
1. Clone the project into local
2. Install all the npm packages for the server side. Go into the project folder, cd into the server folder and type the following command to install all npm packages:
```bash
npm install react react-dom express body-parser cors
```
3. Install all the npm packages for the client side. Go into the project folder, cd into the client folder and type the following command to install all npm packages
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
4. In order to start the server and client application, type the following command (in both, the server and the client folder):
```bash
npm start
```
4. The live development website runs on http://localhost:3000
